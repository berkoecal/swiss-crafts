              As is common practice with almost all professional websites, Weyenthal uses cookies,
              which are tiny files that are downloaded to your device, to improve your experience.
              This page describes what information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes
              need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from
              being stored, however, this may downgrade or &apos;break&apos; certain elements of the
              site&apos;s functionality.

            <p className='leading-relaxed'>
              We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases,
              there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely
              disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that
              you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they
              are used to provide a service that you use.

              You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see
              your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the
              functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will

              Hopefully, that has clarified things for you. As was previously mentioned, if there is
              something that you aren&apos;t sure whether you need or not, it&apos;s usually safer
              to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on
              our site.
